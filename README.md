### Pets For Life

This is the repository for Pets For Life. It is hosted on Render at [PetsForLife](https://pets-for-life.onrender.com/). It is a website that you will be able to use to view available pets up for adoption in your area. There will be resources for new pet owners. On the main page we will display a section for featured pets of the week and the main navigation.  The pets link is where the user will find the search form to search for adoptable pets in the area of the zip code they enter. The search results will show a photo of the animal, name, and other basic facts. There will be a resources list of links to other websites or articles regarding the pet of your choice. There are contact links at the bottom of the page for any questions or concerns regarding pets or the website. 
### Installation:
We will use HTML, CSS, embedded JavaScript, and JavaScript, Git and PostgreSQL. We will use an API from [PetFinder.com](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/) for the pet data. We installed a node package manager and created a skeleton.
**To Do:**
- Create final search page
- Create the new owner resource page(s)/List 
- Update contact form
