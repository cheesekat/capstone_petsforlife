## Pets For Life

This is the repository for Pets For Life. It is hosted on Render at [PetsForLife](https://pets-for-life.onrender.com/). It is a website that you will be able to use to view available pets up for adoption in your area. There will be resources for new pet owners. On the main page we will display a section for featured pets of the week and the main navigation.  The pets link is where the user will find the search form to search for adoptable pets in the area of the zip code they enter. The search results will show a photo of the animal, name, and other basic information. On the Pet Care page you will find links with helpful information on keeping your pets healthy. The Supplies page has links to all of our favorite animal supply stores and websites. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please use the contact form on the About Us page to send us an email.
