## Pets For Life

This is the repository for Pets For Life. It is hosted on Render at [PetsForLife](https://pets-for-life.onrender.com/). It is a website that you will be able to use to view available pets up for adoption in your area. There are many resources for new pet owners. On the main page we will display a section for featured pets and the main navigation.  The pets link is where the user will find the search form to search for adoptable pets in the area of the zip code they enter. The search results will show a photo of the animal, name, and other basic information. On the Care page you will find links with helpful information on keeping your pets healthy. The Supplies page has links to all of our favorite animal supply stores and websites and it also has the checklists for each animal available for printing or using while you online shop If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please use the contact form on the About Us page to send us an email. 
## Installation:
We will use HTML, CSS, embedded JavaScript, and JavaScript, Git and PostgreSQL. We will use an API from [PetFinder.com](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/) for the pet data. We installed a node package manager using Node.js and created a skeleton.
